## Design Process

Hello there! Welcome to Brain Jam, the ultimate tuition center management system where learning becomes an engaging journey. We are Marvin ([@s10260527](https://github.com/s10260527)), Jovan ([@s10257399](https://github.com/LifeRaider)), and Lucas ([@s10257164](https://github.com/LoocasToh)), a team of aspiring developers passionate about education and technology. We created this system to streamline the tuition center experience and foster better connections between students, teachers, and parents. Are you ready to revolutionize learning? 🚀

Our website is designed for ease of use and efficient navigation. Once logged in, users will see a dashboard of their classes. Each role (student, teacher, parent, admin) has access to specific features designed to enhance their experience with the tuition center.

Students can view their classes, assignments, and announcements. How much can you improve your grades? 📈

Teachers can manage their classes, create assignments, and create announcements. They can also receive feedback from parents effectively. Ready to inspire the next generation? 🍎

Parents can monitor their child's progress, view announcements, their assignments, and give feedback to teachers. Stay involved in your child's education journey! 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

Admins have full control over the system, managing users, classes, and overall operations of the tuition center. Streamline your tuition center management today! 🏫

You can access all these features by navigating through the system with ease. Will you help us create the future of education? 💡
